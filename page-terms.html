					<p><h2> General Service Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>
These Terms and Conditions (“Terms” or “Agreement”) represent a binding agreement between Textify and You. It is important that You understand Your responsibilities and the limitations to the services which You choose to use. Our services are diverse and as a result additional service specific terms may apply. If this is the case, these service specific terms shall become part of Our agreement.

Please use Our services responsibly. By using Our website or any of Our services, You agree to Our Terms. Take note that these Terms change from time to time. If You have used Our services before, You cannot assume that the Terms are still the same. You should review them on a regular basis.
</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
        You wish to use Textify services (meaning services as provided under these Terms; hereinafter “Service,” or “Free Service,” collectively the “Services”) as either a paying customer (“Customer”) and/or Our Free Service as a non-paying customer (“Non-Paying Customer”). By applying for the services using Our online registration form You are using Our services as a Non-Paying Customer according to the Clause 3.b until decided otherwise on Textify’s sole discretion.
        Textify means Textify LTD, a company registered in Kenya and whose registered office is situated at 7th Floor, Phoenix House,Nairobi CBD (hereinafter “Textify”; “We”; Our”; “Us”).
        You wish to use the Services and We are willing to make the Services available to You subject to and in accordance with these Terms
		</p>
    <h2>Binding Effect</h2>
	<p>
        You are entering into a binding agreement. If You accept these Terms of use of Our Service on behalf of Your employer or another person, You confirm that You have the consent of Your employer or that person to act on their behalf. THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON Textify’S WEBSITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, You may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are Your sole responsibility.
        You are not eligible to accept these Terms or use Our Services if You are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Us or if You are barred by law to use Our services.
		</p>
		<h2>
    The Service and the Free Service
	</h2>
	<p>
        The Service enables a Paying Customer to use Our mobile services as set out as part of Your online registration.
            Any such billable unit under the Services shall be referred in these Terms and Conditions as a “Chargeable Event”.
        The Free Service will enable Non-Paying Customers to:
            Use the Trial for one or more elements of the Service described in the above clause 3a; and/or
            Use any element of the Service described in the above clause 3a or any other service made available by Us to You free of charge from time to time at Our absolute discretion.
        Some or all elements of the Free Service may be accessed via a web application, an email gateway, a software tool and/or a web service more particularly described on our website at www.Textify.co.ke
		</p>
		<h2>
    Availability and Interruption of the Service
	</h2>
	<p>
        We will make the Services available to You as either a Customer and/or a Non-Paying Customer using reasonable skill and care. You do however acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Services, Your ability to access and/or use the Services and the conducting of any given Chargeable Event may depend upon factors beyond Our reasonable control, including (but not limited to):
            Factors affecting the operation of the Services and/or preventing Chargeable Event from being successfully conducted such as, by way of example, geographical or topographical shortcomings in the network of any telecommunications network operator (“Network Operator”), network capacity, physical obstructions or atmospheric conditions; or
            Factors preventing end-users from receiving Chargeable Events such as, by way of example, the terms and conditions of an end-user’s service provider.
			</p>
			<p>
        We cannot therefore guarantee:
            That the Services will be available to You at all times or free from faults or interruptions;
            The receipt by any intended recipient of any Chargeable Event sent using the Services (as applicable).
        We will not be in any way liable for any failure to make the Services available to You to the extent that such failure results from a technical or other failure on the part of any Network Operator or any other event which is beyond Our reasonable control. We provide all services “as is” and “as available”, and We hereby do not warrant, represent or guarantee, whether expressly or by implication, that any Services are free of errors or interruptions, always available, fit for any purpose, secure or do not infringe any third party rights.
        We may, at Our sole discretion, alter or improve the Services We provide to You at any time, provided that any such alteration does not materially affect the nature or detract from the functionality of the Services.
        It may be necessary from time to time for Us to suspend the Services that We provide to You for routine or emergency maintenance and/or repairs and We will, in so far as it is reasonably possible, provide You with a reasonable period of notice prior to any such suspension.
            We may at Our sole discretion suspend Your access to the Services and/or cease to allow any Chargeable Events to be conducted by You at any time. We are entitled to terminate these Terms for any reason, in which case We will give You appropriate notice as soon as is reasonably possible.
            Should Your account utilized in the provision of Textify Service be inactive through a period of 6 (six) months it remains in Textify’s discretion to suspend Textify Services to You. You can reactivate the account with a request to Textify sent 3 (three) working days prior to the required reactivation.
			</p>
			<h2>
    Management of Your account
	</h2>
	<p>
        After the Free Service session is completed, You will have the option to request the full Service which will enable You to become a Paying Customer.
        A selected member(s) of Our dedicated team of account managers will be allocated to You once You start using the Free Service under these Terms.
        Terms and conditions of the Service will be detailed in written form. In the event of any discrepancy between the Service terms stipulated hereunder and subsequent terms, the latter shall prevail.
		</p>
		<h2>

     Confidentiality and Data Protection
	 </h2>
	 
        You will at all times keep confidential all information acquired as a consequence of using Our Services, except for information already in the public domain or information which You are required to disclose by law, requested by any Regulator or reasonably required by Your professional advisors for the performance of their professional services.
        Each party will comply with all applicable data collection regulations in the processing of any personal data, including the mobile telephone numbers of Your end-user to whom Chargeable Events will be sent as a consequence of making the Services available to You (such personal data referred hereto collectively as “End-User Data”), under or in connection with the Agreement. Please see Our full privacy policy is set out on our website at www.Textify.com.
        We will treat Your End-User Data as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party or use or copy any part of it except for the purposes of making the Services available to You and providing any technical support required. We will make no further use of Your End-User Data without your specific authorization.

		<h2>
    Support services
	</h2>
	<p>
        Unless We agree otherwise in writing, We will provide on-line technical support in respect of the Service and/or Free Service available to You 24/7 at the following e-mail address: support@Textify.com
		</p>
		<p>
    Customer Charges and Payment
	</p>
	</p>
        The provisions of this clause apply to Paying Customers only.
        You agree to pay all Charges due to Us in respect of making the Service available to You and Your access to and use of the Service (“Customer Charges”) by the prepayment method and in accordance with the terms as set hereof.
        You agree to pre-purchase Chargeable Event credits for each month of the Agreement or such other period as is agreed between us, in which case We will allocate to You a corresponding number of Chargeable Events credits for that period. Each Chargeable Event that You conduct using the Service will therefore reduce the value of the Chargeable Event credits available to You by 1 corresponding unit charge (subject to any variation thereof and as agreed with Your account manager).
		</p>
		<p>
        Any Chargeable Event credits purchased by You are only valid for the period in respect of which they have been allocated, any additional expenditure of Chargeable Events, over Your allocation limit, in such period, shall not be possible. However, You will still be allowed to purchase new Chargeable Event credits and expand your allocation for the given period at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
        You shall be solely responsible, by seeking adequate Chargeable Event credit allocation(s) and checking Your remaining available Chargeable Event credit level on Our website at www.Textify.com, for ensuring that You have enough Chargeable Event credits to meet Your requirements from time to time and We shall not be in any way responsible or liable in the event that You have insufficient Chargeable Event credits to meet Your requirements, and/or have exceeded Your Chargeable Event credit allocation(s), for any period.
		</p>
		<p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, a Charge will be incurred for every Chargeable Event conducted by You regardless of whether it is successfully delivered.
        If You do not pay any Customer Charges in accordance with the applicable payment terms, We reserve the right to, in Our sole discretion, suspend Your access to the Service and/or cease to allow any Chargeable Event to be conducted by You until further payment is received by Us which fully covers any unpaid Charges.
		</p>
		<p>
        You are responsible for the payment of all bank and finance charges. Please ensure that the amount received on Our bank account, after deductions, corresponds to the full amount you owe Us.
        You will not be able to receive any refund for the payment made (“No refund, exchange only”). The latter shall not prevent any refund to be made according to the applicable customer protection laws.
		</p>
		<h2>
    Marketing

        Either party may make use of the other party’s name and visual identity for publicity and marketing purposes, without prior consent.

	</h2>
	 <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Textify SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (ii) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, CONTENT AND/OR ANY OTHER SRVICES OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE; (iii) THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, OR ALTERATION OF, YOUR REGISTRATION DATA AND/OR VERIFIED PROFILE; AND (iv) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE WEBSITE AND/OR THE SERVICES OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE.
        THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE Textify ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
		</p>
		<p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold Textify, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Textify by any third party due to, arising out of or in connection with your use of the website and/or the Services.
        We will not be in any way liable for the content of any Chargeable Events sent or transmitted using the Service and the full responsibility for their content shall rest on you. You must observe all relevant legislation and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction of all persons with whom you communicate directly when using the Service. By using the Service you also agree to be bound by the Rules of Use.
        Subject to any express provision to the contrary in these Terms, We will not in any circumstances be liable to You (as either a Customer or a Non-Paying Customer) in contract, tort, negligence or otherwise for any economic loss (including, but not limited to, any loss or profits, business, contracts, revenue, turnover or anticipated savings) or for any indirect or consequential losses, whether or not they were foreseen or foreseeable.
        Each party acknowledges that neither You (as either a Customer or a Non-Paying Customer), nor We, have entered into the Agreement on the basis of or in reliance upon any representation (save for any representation made fraudulently), warranty or other term except as otherwise expressly provided in the Terms and, as such, all conditions, warranties and other terms implied by statute, common law or otherwise are hereby excluded to the greatest extent permitted by law.
		</p>
		<p>
        We shall at all times in respect of the subject matter of these Terms comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules having equivalent effect.

You must follow the applicable complaint procedures and respond to each complaint within the timeframes specified by the relevant regulatory body and must forward a copy of your response to Us immediately.

		</p>
		<h2>
    Term and Termination
	</h2>
	<p>
        Unless otherwise agreed with Your account manager, and subject to earlier termination in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Term is, for an initial minimum, a 12-month period (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term will start on the Start Date (the day when you start using the Service or the Free Service) and expire on the End Date (the day corresponding the date in the month in which the initial service term expires). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, the Agreement will continue automatically unless and until either party gives the other 30 days’ written notice or either You or We otherwise terminate the Agreement in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
        If at any time You wish to terminate the Agreement, You must either:
		</p>
		<p>
            Give Us written notice to that effect within a 7-working day period from and including the Start Date, in order for such notice to take effect immediately; or
            Give Us no less than 30 days’ written notice, such notice will take effect no sooner than the End Date (subject to any variation thereof). If You wish to terminate the Agreement with effect from any date preceding such End Date and are unable to do so for cause or any other reason under these Terms and Conditions, if you are a Customer under the Agreement then You must pay Us the Customer Charges due for each month (or part thereof) remaining of the minimum 12-month period post-termination. Such Customer Charges will be calculated on the basis of the monthly Customer Charges as set out in the Signature Page (as varied if applicable), and any prepayment of Customer Charges that You have made to Us will not be credited or refunded (“No refund, exchange only”). The latter shall not prevent any refund to be made according to the applicable customer protection laws.
			</p>
			<p>
        Either party may also terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by notice to the other party if:
            The other party becomes insolvent, makes any arrangement with or for the benefit of its creditors, goes into compulsory or voluntary liquidation, has a receiver, administrative receiver, liquidator or other similar official appointed over its assets, is subject to an administration or similar order or ceases trading;
            The other party commits a material breach of the Agreement and (where such breach is capable of remedy) fails to remedy the breach within 14 days of a written notice from the party not in breach requiring its remedy; or
            Any license required for Us to operate the Services is revoked, terminated or modified or, in the case of new license requirements being imposed, the applicable license:
                Is not granted to Us; or
                Is granted to Us but in such a way as to prevent Us from continuing to make the Services available or a Network Operator from enabling Us to make the Services available.
				</p>
				<p>
